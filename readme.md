## Objective of the workshop

The goal of this task was to create a dynamic JavaScript form incorporating key features such as validation, data storage, error handling, accessibility, and interactive elements like toggling and blur effects. This exercise aimed to strengthen understanding of how JavaScript can be used to build responsive, fluid web pages for future projects and deepen comprehension of core concepts. The screenshots below illustrate the intended functionality and serve as personal reference notes for future use.

## Accessibility and Security Checklist

### Accessibility Checklist
- Ensure every input has a visible label linked with for and id attributes
- Verify error text uses aria-invalid, aria-describedby, and an alert region
- Confirm focus moves to the first error on submit.
- Check that colour alone does not convey meaning; use text or icons.
- Test all actions with the Tab key for keyboard accessibility.

### Security Checklist
- Always validate data on the server, not just client-side.
- Avoid storing sensitive data (for example, passwords) in localStorage or logs.
- Use HTTPS and keep Application Programming Interface keys on the server.

### Additional checklist
- No console errors
- Phone normalisation with blur
